        <h2>Why Bamboo?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Renewable Resource:
   - Bamboo is a fast-growing grass that can be harvested in a relatively short period compared to traditional hardwoods. This makes it a renewable resource, as bamboo can be replenished quickly, reducing the impact on forests.
</li>
<li>
Low Environmental Impact:
   - The production and processing of bamboo typically have a lower environmental impact compared to traditional building materials like steel or concrete. Bamboo cultivation requires fewer chemicals and less energy, contributing to a smaller carbon footprint.
</li>
<li>
Biodegradability:
   - Bamboo is a natural material that is biodegradable. At the end of its life cycle, bamboo can decompose, reducing the amount of waste generated compared to non-biodegradable materials.
</li>
<li>
Strength and Durability:
   - Bamboo is known for its strength and durability. It has a high strength-to-weight ratio, making it a suitable material for various construction purposes, including water tanks. Properly treated bamboo can resist pests and decay, extending its lifespan.
</li>
<li>
Local Sourcing:
   - Bamboo is often available locally in many regions, reducing the need for transportation over long distances. Using locally sourced materials can lower transportation-related carbon emissions and support local economies.
</li>
<li>
Adaptability:
   - Bamboo is versatile and can be used in various construction applications, including water tanks. Its flexibility allows for creative and adaptable designs, making it suitable for different project requirements.
</li>
<li>
Carbon Sequestration:
   - Bamboo absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) during its growth, acting as a carbon sink. Choosing bamboo over materials that have a higher carbon footprint, such as concrete or steel, can help mitigate the overall carbon impact of construction projects.
</li>
<li>
Cultural and Social Benefits:
   - In some regions, bamboo has cultural significance, and using it in construction projects can help preserve traditional building practices. Additionally, the cultivation and processing of bamboo can create employment opportunities in local communities.</p>

        <h2>Maintenance Tips</h2>
        <ol>
<li>
               Maintanence
Maintenance begins immediately after the tank has been built, be sure 
to keep the tank shaded for 10 - 15 days and splash the tank with water to help it dry slowly and evenly and cure without cracking.
</li>
<li>
Never let the tank become completely dry to avoid damage.
</li>
<li>
In daily use, keep the tank and the surrounding area clean and tidy, 
and do not allow any foreign matter to pollute the stored water
</li>
<li>
Repair shallow cracks on the tanks surface begin by roughing up the 
surface around the crack moistening the area with water, and then 
filling the crack with plaster. Smooth repaired portion 
</li>
<li>
In case the tap or drain valve are 
clogged, the user removes, cleans and 
re-fix them using wrench and pliers. 
To fix the annexes you must use Teflon 
to prevent water drops 
</li>
<li>
The owner must save some money 
to help for the eventual repairs and/
or replacing water tank annexes (tap, 
drain valve an         </li>
